jQuery Color Animation for Meteorite
====================================
Meteorite package for Color Animation, a jQuery plugin by Edwin Martin
that adds color capability to $.animate().

From the website:

This plugin is based on Color Animations by John Resig. It fixes a major bug and also adds support for the borderColor-property.

This plugin also adds rgba-colors, so now you can animate the transparency of the background and foreground text independently. Beware that Internet Explorer 8 and earlier don't support rgba-colors.
